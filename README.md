# BTech-Project-(Zero Day Attack Detection)

CreateÂ a real-time anomaly detection system to detect zero-day threats. Our approach leverages anomaly detection techniques and unsupervised learning to identify abnormalities in system logs and network traffic, as traditional methods are ineffective when dealing with unexpected threats.
